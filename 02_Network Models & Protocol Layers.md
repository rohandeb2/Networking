## **5. OSI Model (Open Systems Interconnection Model)**

### ‚úÖ What is the OSI Model?

The **OSI Model** is a theoretical model created by the **ISO (International Standards Organization)** that explains **how data travels** through a network in **seven structured layers**.

It helps us understand what happens when you open a website, send a file, or use Zoom‚Äî**from one device to another across a network**.

### üìä The 7 Layers of OSI (Top to Bottom):

| Layer # | Name         | What It Does (Beginner Explanation)        |
| ------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| 7       | Application  | User-facing software (browser, apps)       |
| 6       | Presentation | Translates data (encryption, formats)      |
| 5       | Session      | Starts/stops communication sessions        |
| 4       | Transport    | Breaks data into smaller pieces (segments) |
| 3       | Network      | Adds source/destination IP (routing)       |
| 2       | Data Link    | Adds MAC addresses (local delivery)        |
| 1       | Physical     | Actual cable, WiFi, or fiber sending bits  |

### üß† Real-Life Analogy:

Imagine sending a package:

* You (Application) write a letter.
* You choose the language (Presentation).
* You decide when to start/end the chat (Session).
* You split it into smaller envelopes (Transport).
* You write the receiver‚Äôs address (Network).
* You stick it to the right truck (Data Link).
* The truck drives the package (Physical).

## **6. Why OSI Model is Not Used in the Real World**

The OSI model is great **for learning**, but in real-world networking, we mostly use the **TCP/IP model**.

### üö´ Reasons Why OSI Is Not Practically Used:

1. **Too Complex** ‚Äì 7 layers are not always needed.
2. **Not All Layers Are Clear in Practice** ‚Äì Presentation and Session are often merged with Application.
3. **TCP/IP Became the Standard** ‚Äì It was adopted earlier in UNIX and the Internet.
4. **OSI was Theoretical** ‚Äì It came from academic/commercial thinking, while TCP/IP was **developed by engineers**.

So, engineers and DevOps people today **refer to OSI for learning**, but **implement real systems using TCP/IP.**

## **7. TCP/IP Model**

The **TCP/IP Model** is the **real-world standard** used in the Internet and all modern networking. It has **4 layers**, and it maps roughly to the OSI Model.

### üåê 4 Layers of TCP/IP Model:

| Layer          | Equivalent OSI Layers | What It Does                               |
| -------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Application    | OSI Layers 7, 6, 5    | Interface for user apps (HTTP, DNS, FTP)   |
| Transport      | OSI Layer 4           | Manages data delivery (TCP/UDP)            |
| Internet       | OSI Layer 3           | Chooses path to destination (IP addresses) |
| Network Access | OSI Layers 2, 1       | Sends data physically (Ethernet, Wi-Fi)    |

### üîß Key Protocols Used:

| Layer          | Protocols Used         |
| -------------- | ---------------------- |
| Application    | HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, SMTP |
| Transport      | TCP, UDP               |
| Internet       | IP (IPv4, IPv6), ICMP  |
| Network Access | Ethernet, Wi-Fi, ARP   |

## **Packet Structure: Datagram, Version, Header Length, Flags, Fragment Offset, etc.**

When you send data (like an email or a video), it‚Äôs broken down into **packets** (or **datagrams**) that are sent across the internet.

Let‚Äôs look inside the **IP Packet** (IPv4) ‚Äì this is how data is structured when sent.

---

### üì¶ What‚Äôs Inside an IP Datagram?

| Field              | Meaning (Simple Explanation)                           |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Version            | IPv4 or IPv6 (usually 4)                               |
| Header Length      | Size of the header in 32-bit words                     |
| Type of Service    | Priority of the packet (like urgent, normal, etc.)     |
| Total Length       | Entire size of packet (header + data)                  |
| Identification     | Unique ID to group packets that belong together        |
| Flags              | Tells if packet can be fragmented                      |
| Fragment Offset    | Position of this piece if packet was split             |
| Time to Live (TTL) | Limits how far a packet can travel (like expiry timer) |
| Protocol           | Tells if it‚Äôs TCP or UDP inside                        |
| Header Checksum    | Used to check for errors in header                     |
| Source IP          | Sender‚Äôs IP address                                    |
| Destination IP     | Receiver‚Äôs IP address                                  |
| Options            | Optional settings (rarely used)                        |

### üß† Real-Life Analogy:

Imagine a parcel:

* You write your name (source IP), and friend‚Äôs name (destination IP).
* You mark it as fragile or not (flags).
* You give it a number (ID).
* If it‚Äôs too big, it‚Äôs broken into smaller boxes (fragment offset).
* You set expiry (TTL).


* **DevOps needs networking** to manage cloud, deployment, communication between services, and secure operations.
