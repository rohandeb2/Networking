## **1. What is the Internet?**

The Internet is a global network of **interconnected computers** that communicate with each other using **standard protocols** (especially TCP/IP).

### 🧠 How It Works:

* Think of the internet like a **giant web** connecting millions of computers and devices worldwide.
* It allows you to **send information** (like websites, videos, emails) from one device to another using a shared communication language (protocol).
* The **main job** of the Internet is to transfer **data packets** from one device to another across different networks.

### 🔄 Real-World Analogy:

* Imagine sending a letter. You write the letter, put it in an envelope, and post it.
* It goes through local, regional, national, and international post offices until it reaches your friend.
* The **Internet does the same**—your "letter" (data) travels across multiple networks to reach its destination.

### 📌 Key Concepts:

* **IP Address** – Unique ID of your device on the Internet (like a home address).
* **Router** – Like a post office. It decides where your data should go.
* **ISP (Internet Service Provider)** – The company that gives you access to the Internet (like Airtel, Jio, Comcast).

## **2. Tiers of Internet (Tier 3 to Tier 1) – with Real-Life Examples**

The Internet is not just one big cable—it’s **layered**. These layers are called **tiers**, and each has a different level of responsibility and reach.

### 📶 Tier 3: Local ISP (Retail)

* These are **local internet providers**.
* Example: Airtel, BSNL, JioFiber (India), Comcast (USA).
* They sell internet to homes, offices, and small businesses.
* They **do not own** large-scale infrastructure. They pay Tier 2 for internet access.

### 🌐 Tier 2: Regional Providers

* They **serve multiple regions or countries**.
* They buy access from Tier 1 providers and **resell it** to Tier 3.
* Example: Tata Communications, Cogent, NTT.
* They sometimes have their own fiber cables and data centers.

### 🛰️ Tier 1: Backbone Providers

* These are the **highest level of Internet providers**.
* They own **massive infrastructure**, including undersea cables and satellite networks.
* They **don’t pay anyone** for data—they exchange traffic with other Tier 1 networks (called **peering**).
* Examples: AT\&T, Verizon, Tata Communications (in some cases), Level 3 Communications (now Lumen).

## **3. How Internet is Provided to Servers with Firewalls**

Now that we know how internet reaches end users, let’s see how it reaches **servers** (e.g., websites like Google, Netflix, your application).

### 🖥️ Step-by-Step Path of Internet to Server:

1. **Data Center or Cloud Provider** hosts your server (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud).
2. These providers are connected to **Tier 1 or Tier 2 providers** directly.
3. **Network Interface Card (NIC)** connects the server to a **switch** in a data center.
4. The **switch** connects to a **router**.
5. The **router** is protected by a **firewall**.
6. Finally, your server gets a **public IP address**, and Internet traffic can reach it.

### 🔥 What is a Firewall?

* A **firewall is a security system** that filters incoming and outgoing traffic.
* It decides which traffic is **allowed** (e.g., web traffic) and which is **blocked** (e.g., hacking attempts).
* It can be a **hardware device** or **software application**.

### 🔐 Example:

* Only allow traffic on port 80 (HTTP) and 443 (HTTPS).
* Block all other traffic like FTP, SSH, etc., unless specifically allowed.

## **4. Why Networking is Important in DevOps**

DevOps is not just about CI/CD or automation—**networking is a core pillar**.

### 🔧 Here’s Why:

#### 1. **Server Communication**

* DevOps manages multiple servers (frontend, backend, DB).
* These need to **talk to each other** over the network.
* Example: Backend server must connect to the database server securely.

#### 2. **Deployment over Networks**

* When you deploy applications, you push them over networks—often to remote servers.
* You must understand **IP addressing**, **ports**, **DNS**, **routing**, etc.

#### 3. **Cloud & Containers**

* Cloud platforms like AWS rely on **Virtual Private Networks (VPC)**, subnets, and firewalls.
* Kubernetes clusters also use **networking layers** (like CNI plugins, services, ingress).

#### 4. **Security**

* A DevOps engineer should configure **firewalls**, **SSL certificates**, **VPNs**, and **network policies**.
* Bad networking means a hacker could enter through an open port.

#### 5. **Monitoring and Logging**

* DevOps tools monitor network traffic (like Prometheus, Nagios).
* Alerts are triggered based on **network latency**, **bandwidth usage**, **packet loss**, etc.
